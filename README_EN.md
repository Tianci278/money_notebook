It will show you your recent balance, analyze your specific income and expenditure over time, and also help you make future income and expenditure plans. Let's take a look at exactly how it should be used.

# First start
When " Money Notebook" is launched for the first time, select the language (Chinese and English) and the base currency unit.

# Create time blocks
A time block is the basic unit of account of "Money Notebook". A time block represents the income and expenditure of a period of time, including information about the time period, total income and expenditure and specific income and expenditure categories.  
After the initialization, the program will create your first time block. After that, you can create more time blocks in the main interface by typing "c".
Here you enter the start and end time, then the balance and the total income and expenditure.  
While entering the balance and the total income and expenditure, you can connect multiple entries with a plus sign "+", e.g. "3000 + 5000".  
If you add another currency code after the amount, e.g. "5000 + 300 GBP", the program will convert the 300 GBP to your base currency according to the real-time exchange rate.

[img-3 Enter time balance total income and expenditure etc.]  
After you have finished entering, follow the menu prompts to record your specific income and expenditure categories, the information recorded here will eventually be displayed in the main interface of the program.

[img-5 Interface for recording income and expenditure classification]  
You can now make a note of your income and expenditure for the period according to your bill, with positive amounts as income and negative amounts as expenditure.  
Add a currency code (e.g. + food -15 GBP) to the amount to convert it to the base currency.  
When all entries are complete, type "f" to complete the process.  
In the main screen, enter "m + space + time block code" to modify a time block, "d + space + time block code" to delete a time block.  
Enter "s + space + time block code" to view the statistics of one or more time blocks.  

# Create planner blocks
Planner is used to plan the future predictable income and expenditure items, so you can see the future balance at a glance.

[img-6 Planner block showing predictable future income and expenditure]  
Enter "+" to create a planner block and "- + space + code" to delete a block.  
Afterwards all future plans will be shown in the main program interface and all past plans will be automatically hidden.

# Other
The program will automatically create a backup of each every time you open and close it. If you delete the wrong thing by mistake, you can restore it by using the backup.  
Unfortunately, exe files can be reported as virus by the system. The reason is that the wrapper used, pyinstaller, is often used to create viruses, so antivirus software automatically classifies all programs created with this wrapper and without a signature as viruses.  
The solution is to add the program to your system's antivirus whitelist, or to simply run .py script in python.
